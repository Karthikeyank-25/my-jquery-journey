// What is jQuery?
//          - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
//          - It makes HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
//          - Released in 2006 by John Resig.
//          - Very popular for simplifying JavaScript programming, especially before modern frameworks took off.

// Syntax :

            $(selector).action();

// $ is the jQuery function.
// selector is used to select HTML elements.
